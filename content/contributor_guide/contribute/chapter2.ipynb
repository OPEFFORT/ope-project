    "You will want to create your own forked repository from one of the [ope repositories](https://github.com/OPEFFORT). The main development repository is the [ope-project](https://github.com/OPEFFORT/ope-project) repo. You can then make changes within your own forked repo and then open a pull reuqest to the associated OPEFFORT repo. \n",

    "There are three important folders that you will use in the ope-project repo: /containers, /content, /books. The containers folder will hold all of the configurations and the Dockerfile for your docker image. The content folder will hold all of the .ipynb files plus additional files used to structure your book. The books folder contains the makefile to build and publish your book from the content folder.\n",

    "## The Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The OPE project utilizes python3 as the main language. The environment is centered around the utilization of the `jupyter-book` package. We also utilize [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) in order to build and deploy the containers. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is used to automate the building of the project. The containers are currently being deployed onto the [New England Research Cloud](https://nerc.mghpcc.org/) (NERC) using [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) and [Red Hat OpenShift Data Science](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science) (RHODS).\n",

    "### Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to first setup a virtual environment to install the necessary packages to. In order to set the virtual environment up you must first have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system. Once that is done, open a terminal within the development repository and do the following to setup the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "mkdir .venv/ ; python3 -m venv .venv/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the following command in the same directory as the .venv/ directory in order to activate the virtual environment\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual environment can be deactivated by executing the following command\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual environment has been activated, use pip to install the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "```shell\n",

    "## Customizing Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Every new project that is created contains the base container image located within containers/default in the project repo. Navigate to the containers/default directory and run make build in order to build this base image. The base image typically takes ~15 mins to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to customize the base image, navigate to containers/default/base and make changes to the following files as needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **python_prereqs:** Python packages that will be installed right before installing the main python packages, specified in the file right below this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **python_pkgs:** Python packages that will be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **distro_pkgs:** Linux distro packages that will be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dockerfile:** The base OPE image is created in a way such that you can modify the configuration files above in order to install the necessary software within the container. However, you may need to modify the Dockerfile in order to fit more specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to also make changes to these following files in order to get your image tagged correctly and to ensure it gets pushed to the correct container registry repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **customization_name:** Image tag name \n",
    "\n",
    "- **ope_book_registry:** The name of the container registry site\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ope_book_user:** The username for the account where the repository is located on the container registry site\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ope_book:** The name of the repository on the container registry user account\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "ope_book_registry/ope_book_user/ope_book defines the url for the repository within the container registry site. For example, quay.io/opeffort/ope_book.\n",

    "You will need to have the Docker daemon running in the background to build your image.\n",

    "### Startup Script\n",
    "\n",
    "A [startup script](https://github.com/OPEFFORT/ope-project/blob/main/containers/default/base/start-notebook.d/ope-sartup.sh) is executed during image building (specified at the end of the Dockerfile). This startup script is responsible for mounting the home directory in order to achieve permanent storage. If this script is not executed and the home directory is not mounted, the home directory within the resulting container is deleted when the container is stopped. The script needs to be executed as the jovyan user during image building in order to have the correct permission to mount the home directory toa  permanent storage. \n",

    "\n",
    "### UID/GID \n",
    "\n",
    "When developing on the NERC test cluster, the ope_uid value is set to be 1000810000 in order to match the NERC environment. For the BU-ROSA cluster, it may assign containers with different UID/GID, so we have to customize the [ope_uid](https://github.com/OPEFFORT/ope-project/blob/main/containers/default/base/ope_uid) and [ope_gid](https://github.com/OPEFFORT/ope-project/blob/main/containers/default/base/ope_gid) value to match that environment. These values can be changed accordingly for the necessary environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Container Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "After the image has been built, it may be run locally using `make`. Navigate to the directory that has the name of the image you are trying to run (ex. containers/default). Once you are in this directory with the `Makefile`, run `Make root` in order to execute the locally built image as a container. Refer to section 10, [Building and Publishing Image](https://isaiahstapleton.github.io/ope-project/user_guide/container/chapter2.html) of the user guide for more information.\n"
