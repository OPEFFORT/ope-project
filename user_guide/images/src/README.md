# Source for files for image content

Please place source for images in this directory.  Please use open source tools and file formats.  The recommended format is draw.io xml. 

See https://www.diagrams.net/about 

While the jupyterlab environment has support for editing drawio files at this point we recommend that you use the desktop version as it is more stable.  Please be sure to commit all your source to your repository.
